then down to the leaf node to find the target node, that alone makes it kind of slow when finding the shortest path, because it will gather **all** the possible ways from the traversals then determine which is the best path, but it gives you all the solutions and/or path from a graph.\n","\n","*Breadth First* however, goes through finding the targeted node by going through the neighboring nodes and when the node is found it immidiately returns it and shows the path, that cuts the time it takes to find the target node, but that solution is temporary and can not be as good as depth first's way of finding the best
